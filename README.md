<h3>Project Description</h3>
This project is for a class named ENSE 374, a course on software engineering management with the University of Regina. We have been tasked with creating a small-medium scale web-based application on any topic of our choosing.

<h3>Our Idea and "Why"</h3>
Our team has decided to make an app that makes it easier for people to get the information they need about recycling. Generally, people have good intentions when it comes to recycling, but often do not know how, and don't bother learning. Due to this, we see the need for an all in one information application, where users can go to find what they're looking for, from a trustworthy source. 
<br/>
<br/>
Recycling is extremely necessary for the success of our species moving forward. Without it, waste buildup would get out control and result in an inhabitable planet for us. By recycling, we are helping to eliminate this risk, while contributing to other issues such as pollution in general, and climate change. Without a healthy planet, we have no future. For this reason, our group sees this project as an opportunity to do something worthwhile. An app that encourages more people to start recycling through its ease of use, is something that we can make, which has the potential to make a difference.
<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately the reason "why" we have chosen this idea, is to raise awareness and do something about the urgent global issues we are facing. Doing something worthwhile, and growing as software engineers at the same time, is truly an opportunity we could not refuse.
